                    Business and technology hubs are developing trend globally to ensure entrepreneurs, business start-ups, self– employed
                    people and small business owners have a low-cost option in creating, developing and maintaining a sustainable business.
                    This database project is created to track the generic innovation and entrepreneurial ecosystem
                    enablers across Ghana (Ghana Technology and Business Hubs Network). Member hubs and affiliates must be legally registered
                    organisations or businesses based in Ghana to be part of the group. The hub should have a physical facility for gathering
                    its target groups. The group has business meetings and various committees to excute agendas as per agreed. Individual hubs
                    have partners both in Ghana and outside with each having specific customer segments to serve. The database seeks to manage
                    its operations and monitor the performance and relationship between the hubs in the network and also and to lead the
                    development of a cohesive and strengthened tech and business eco-system in Ghana.

                    <span>Elpidia</span> is an organization that seeks to promote the use of technology and innovative approaches to learning
                    and teaching all over Africa. Elpidia is the Greek word for hope. We are convinced in the potential that
                    resides in Africa’s youth, and we look to the future with hope. Never has there been a point in history,
                    when so many people could be empowered with tools to change the world for good in such inexpensive and effective ways.
                    The spider in Elpidia’s logo represents our believe that as a people, as a civilization, we can build our way to any
                    destination we set our eyes to. Elpidia provides primary and high schools with a tool that helps teachers and administrators
                    to record student progress, with a host of easy-to-use data analysis tools that help teachers to analyse student performance
                    on a personal and group bases. The app greatly eases the rather painstaking process of recording students progress while
                    encouraging every teacher to interact with technology.
